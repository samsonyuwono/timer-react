# Timer React

Timer React provides the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based
front-end for my Timer project.  [Timer
Rails](https://github.com/snsavage/timer-rails) provides the backend API for
this project.  Timer React is currently a work in progress.  A live demo of the
project is available at
[https://react-timer.snsavage.com/](https://react-timer.snsavage.com/).

Timer React was created as a project for the [ Flatiron School's Online Web
Developer Program](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-web-developer-career-course).

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

Create React App comes packaged with several helpful scripts including: 

```bash
$ npm start       # Runs development server.
$ npm test        # Runs the test runner.
$ npm run build   # Creates production version of app.
```

*Note: This React app expects access to an API backend.  In
development make sure to start the development Rails server, found
[here](https://github.com/snsavage/timer-rails) with `rails server -p 3001`*.

## Testing

Timer React has a limited test suite.  Tests can be run with:

```bash
$ npm test
```
